# Twitter_ETL_Apache_Airflow
This project implements an Apache Airflow DAG to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of Twitter data. The DAG is scheduled to fetch real-time or historical Twitter data, process it, and store it in a data warehouse for analysis.

#Workflow Steps
# 1.Data Extraction:

Uses Twitter API (via Tweepy or another library) to collect tweets based on keywords, hashtags, or user mentions.
Retrieves metadata such as tweet text, timestamp, user details, and engagement metrics.

# 2.Data Transformation:

Cleans and processes raw Twitter data (removing duplicates, handling missing values, normalizing text).
Extracts structured information such as hashtags, mentions, and sentiment analysis.
Converts the data into a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV, or Parquet).

# 3.Data Loading:

Stores transformed data into a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Amazon Redshift, or Google BigQuery).
Saves raw and processed data into a cloud storage solution like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage.

# Airflow DAG Components
# Operators:
PythonOperator to call API and process data.
BashOperator for shell script executions.
PostgresOperator or BigQueryOperator to load data into a data warehouse.
# Scheduling:
Runs the DAG at scheduled intervals (e.g., every hour, daily, or real-time streaming).
# Logging & Monitoring:
Uses Airflowâ€™s logging and alerting to track failures and retries.

#Use Cases
Social Media Analysis: Track trends, sentiments, and engagement.
Marketing Insights: Monitor brand mentions and competitor activities.
News & Event Monitoring: Detect breaking news and emerging topics.
